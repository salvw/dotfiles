# Sal's Dotfiles
### Prerequisites:
- **git**: to manage this
- **fish**: shell
- **nnn**: filebrowser
- ... more later

Create universal variable my_dotfiles where the repo is going to reside:

`set -U my_dotfiles /projects/dotfiles.git`

Set up a fish alias for git which sets the .git directory to $my_dotfiles and the working tree to $HOME
